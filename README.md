## 🎯 Overview

**NOVA** is an enterprise-grade AI analytics platform designed to predict and prevent employee burnout, attrition, and organizational health crises **before they happen**.

Using advanced machine learning, statistical anomaly detection, and network analysis, NOVA provides HR leaders with **actionable insights** and **AI-recommended interventions** to protect their most valuable assets: their people.

### Key Statistics
- **15+ role-aware dashboards and panels** for organizational health
- **100-employee canonical directory** with deterministic NOVA IDs and shared hierarchy fields
- **8 intervention types** automatically recommended by AI
- **5 behavioral anomaly detectors** using Z-score analysis
- **Network-based burnout propagation modeling**
- **7 enterprise expansion modules** now integrated (OAuth, reporting, benchmarking, Jira signals, manager 360, onboarding watch, PWA)
- **Role-based access control** for HR, Managers, Leadership, and Employees

---

## 🔴 The Problem

### The Burnout Crisis
- **76% of employees** report experiencing burnout at least sometimes
- **High-performing employees** leave at 5x the rate due to burnout
- **Average turnover cost**: 50-200% of annual salary
- **Detection lag**: Companies typically notice burnout **3-6 months too late**

### Current State of HR Analytics
❌ Reactive dashboards (showing past trends, not predicting future)  
❌ No early intervention system (waiting for employee complaints)  
❌ Silent departures (high performers leaving before anyone notices)  
❌ Isolated metrics (burnout, sentiment, performance not connected)  
❌ No network effects considered (burnout spreading through teams)  
❌ Manual intervention planning (rules of thumb, not data-driven)

---

## ✅ Our Solution

### 🤖 AI-Powered Prediction Engine

**NOVA combines three powerful approaches:**

#### 1. **Rule-Based Burnout Scoring** (Instant, Explainable)
```
Risk Score = (
  0.30 × overtime_hours +
  0.20 × unused_pto_days +
  0.25 × negative_sentiment +
  0.15 × meeting_load +
  0.10 × tenure_risk
)
```
- Visible rules → stakeholders understand the scoring
- Instant calculation → real-time dashboards
- Calibrated on IBM HR Analytics dataset

#### 2. **LLM-Enriched Analysis** (Context-aware, Nuanced)
- **Groq AI integration** analyzes text feedback, survey responses, performance notes
- Generates natural language explanations of risk drivers
- Produces standardized 3-bullet summaries and action recommendations
- Streaming responses for real-time dashboards
- Sentiment engine also checks **sarcasm cues** (positive wording with negative intent)
- Judge demo prompt samples for the existing Sentiment Analyzer:
  - Should detect sarcasm:
    - "Oh great, another all-hands meeting. Just what I needed on a Friday afternoon."
    - "Sure, I absolutely love staying until 9 PM every single day. Best work-life balance ever."
    - "Wow, my manager finally responded to my message. Only took three weeks."
    - "Yeah, the new process is amazing. We now need 6 approvals to send one email."
  - Should NOT detect sarcasm:
    - "The team lunch today was really fun, felt good to connect outside work."
    - "Got great feedback on my presentation, feeling motivated."
  - Edge case (subtle sarcasm):
    - "I'm sure the 'optional' team outing that managers track attendance for will be very relaxing."

#### 3. **Statistical Anomaly Detection** (Early Warning System)
- **Z-score analysis** detects sudden behavioral shifts (not just absolute scores)
- **5 detection types**: Sentiment crashes, engagement drops, performance declines, after-hours surges, communication drops
- **Composite detection**: 3+ simultaneous anomalies = **CRITICAL alert**
- Example: Employee's sentiment yesterday: 0.5 → today: -0.8 = **2.8σ anomaly**

#### 4. **Network-Based Risk Propagation** (Contagion Modeling)
- Models burnout as epidemiological network spread
- Calculates centrality (influence, bridge positions, isolation)
- Estimates propagation risk: `Risk = 0.4×own + 0.3×neighbors + 0.2×centrality×neighbor_avg + 0.1×degree`
- **Identifies burnout clusters** spreading through teams

#### 5. **Onboarding Cohort Baselines** (Fair Comparison for New Joiners)
- Detects employees in first 90 days and marks onboarding phase explicitly
- Uses onboarding baseline logic instead of org-wide comparisons for early-tenure risk
- Adds onboarding risk flags: **Integration Risk**, **Ramp Risk**, **Isolation Risk**
- Exposes onboarding watchlist for HR/Leadership via dedicated endpoint

### 🎯 Intelligent Intervention Engine

**8 Intervention Types** automatically recommended based on AI analysis:

| Intervention | Trigger | Timeline | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1:1 Check-in** | Burnout ≥ 0.75 + negative sentiment | 24-48h | 60-70% report clarity |
| **Workload Reduction** | Chronic high burnout | 1-2 weeks | -20-30% burnout |
| **Peer Mentoring** | Engagement drop + isolation | 6 weeks | +20-30% engagement |
| **Wellness Program** | Sustained high risk ≥ 3 weeks | 4 weeks | -10-15% stress |
| **Promotion Discussion** | High performer + retention risk | 1-2 weeks | 5x better retention |
| **Sabbatical** | Severe burnout (0.95+) | ASAP | 40% recovery in 2w |
| **Team Building** | Low team engagement | 4 weeks | +25% team sentiment |
| **Flexible Schedule** | Work-life imbalance signal | 3 weeks | -20-30% burnout |

### Data Flow
1. **Data Ingestion** → Employee data from HR systems → Supabase
2. **Analysis** → FastAPI processes data concurrently
   - Burnout scoring (rules)
   - Sentiment analysis (Groq LLM)
   - Retention assessment (hybrid)
   - Performance prediction (LLM)
   - Anomaly detection (Z-score)
   - Network analysis (centrality, propagation)
3. **Recommendations** → Intervention Engine generates suggestions
4. **Visualization** → Real-time dashboards + alerts
5. **Logging** → Track interventions & outcomes

### Employee Identity and Hierarchy Flow
1. **Canonical Directory Seed** → Backend builds deterministic employee directory with NOVA IDs
2. **Shared Consumption** → Employee pages, org-tree endpoints, and analytics widgets read the same roster model
3. **Hierarchy Projection** → `reports_to` relationships are transformed into subtree/full-tree API responses
4. **UI Rendering** → Focused org chart and full org page render identical identities and reporting lines

## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- Git

### Backend Setup

**1. Clone repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nova.git
cd nova/backend
```

**2. Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell
# or
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
```

**3. Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Configure environment:**
```bash
# Copy example config
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your values:
# SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
# SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key
# GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
```

**5. Run database migrations:**
```bash
# Recommended order in Supabase SQL editor:
# 001_create_users_table.sql
# 002_create_interventions_table.sql
# 003_add_hierarchy_fields.sql
# 003_create_employee_feedback_table.sql
# 004_employee_feedbacks.sql
# feedback_sessions.sql
# 004_employee_actions_tables.sql
# 005_feedback_sessions_status_update.sql

# Optional scripted helpers (reads backend/.env):
# python scripts/apply_feedback_sessions_migration.py
# python scripts/apply_employee_actions_migration.py
# python scripts/apply_employee_feedbacks_migration.py
# python scripts/apply_hierarchy_migration.py
# python scripts/seed_feedbacks.py
```

### Frontend Setup

**1. Navigate to frontend:**
```bash
cd ../frontend
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Configure environment:**
```bash
# Edit .env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

**4. Enable Google OAuth in Supabase:**
- In Supabase Auth Providers, enable Google
- Add site URL and redirect URL for your frontend (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/login?oauth=google`)
- Ensure allowed email domains/org policy align with your employee directory

**5. Run frontend tests (optional but recommended):**
```bash
npm run test
```

Voice UX browser note:
- Chrome and Edge provide the best Web Speech API support.
- On unsupported browsers, NOVA Assistant automatically falls back to text-only mode.

Lightweight integration coverage now includes:
- sidebar badge polling behavior (`AppLayout.badges.test.tsx`)
- what-if modal scroll/backdrop-close behavior (`WhatIfSimulator.modal.test.tsx`)

### Troubleshooting

**1. Missing Supabase tables (`PGRST205` / relation does not exist)**
- Symptom: API errors mention missing tables such as `public.feedback_sessions` or `public.internal_messages`.
- Fix: run the setup SQL in the migration order listed above.
- Optional verification scripts from `backend/`:
```bash
python scripts/verify_feedback_tables.py
python scripts/verify_employee_action_tables.py
```
- HR Feedback Analyzer specific fix path:
```bash
python scripts/apply_employee_feedbacks_migration.py
python scripts/seed_feedbacks.py
```

**2. HR Feedback Analyzer still says table unavailable after migration**
- Cause: PostgREST schema cache delay (table exists in SQL but REST path has stale schema snapshot).
- Fix options:
  - Restart backend and retry.
  - Use the bootstrap endpoint once (HR role): `POST /api/hr/feedbacks/bootstrap`.

**3. Frontend cannot reach backend (NetworkError / fetch failed / empty panels)**
- Symptom: scheduling, review, or insights requests fail despite backend running.
- Fix: confirm frontend `.env` uses the backend host and port actually running locally:
```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
- Then restart the frontend dev server after changing `.env`.

**4. Session Queue not updating after scheduling**
- Symptom: a session is scheduled successfully but does not appear in Sessions to Review.
- Checks:
  - Verify `feedback_sessions` rows are being created in Supabase.
  - Confirm signed-in role can access HR/leadership review surfaces.
  - Ensure the app is not calling a stale origin (all review calls should use the shared API client and `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).

**5. Reminder send errors after successful scheduling**
- Symptom: reminder call fails, but the session appears scheduled.
- Cause: `internal_messages` table missing or policy issue.
- Fix: apply `004_employee_actions_tables.sql` and re-test reminder send.

**6. Composite risk shows 0% unexpectedly**
- Context: anomaly composite can be 0% when no significant anomalies are detected.
- Current behavior: UI falls back to baseline composite risk (workload/sentiment/performance/engagement model) when anomaly composite has no signal.
- If still 0%: inspect input histories (sentiment/performance/engagement) for the selected employee and verify data generation/API payloads are non-empty.

**7. Org Tree page shows "Unable to load hierarchy"**
- Confirm backend is actually running on port 8000 from the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
- Validate API health quickly:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```
- If frontend was started before backend was healthy, restart frontend once after confirming `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

**8. Two different employee groups appear across pages**
- Cause: stale browser state or an old frontend bundle after roster-unification updates.
- Fix:
  - hard refresh the browser (`Ctrl+F5`)
  - ensure frontend and backend are both restarted
  - verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000`
  - if needed, clear site data for `localhost:8080` and sign in again
- Expected state: Employees, Org Tree, Org Wellbeing risk cards, and heatmap detail all use the same canonical roster.

**9. Voice input is unavailable or mic does not start**
- If your browser lacks Web Speech API support, NOVA Assistant automatically runs in text-only mode.
- Recommended browsers: Chrome or Edge.
- If supported browser still fails: verify microphone permission and refresh once.

## 🔐 RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

### Roles & Permissions

| Role | Access Level | Visible Data |
|------|---|---|
| **Employee** | Self-only | Own profile, own insights, personal dashboard |
| **Manager** | Team-level | Team members, team dashboard, effectiveness scores |
| **HR** | Organization-wide | All employees, reports, interventions, trends |
| **Leadership** | Executive | Org wellbeing, strategic insights, benchmarking |

### Voice Assistant Scope by Role

| Role | Voice Assistant Data Scope | Example Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Employee** | Personal-only | Answers personal questions; no peer/team/org comparisons |
| **Manager** | Team-level only | Team insights and manager actions; no org-wide numeric comparisons |
| **HR** | Organization-wide | Full org metrics with specific values and cross-department comparisons |
| **Leadership** | Organization-wide (executive) | Full org summaries, trends, and strategic comparisons |

NOVA Assistant enforces these limits on every `/api/agent/chat` turn by passing the authenticated role to the active specialized agent.

### Endpoint Protection
All API endpoints require valid JWT token with appropriate role.

Example request:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/ai/sentiment
```
